                        A dream is the sunshine that tears through dark clouds. A warm blanket to tuck under when the nights get cold. A wish your heart makes on shooting stars and floating feathers. But not all dreams get a chance.<br/><br/>Like the dream Anita saw from the window of the cancer ward. Or the one that escaped Mohan's lips every night, when he lay down with 6 sibling in the shanty owned by his father, a labourer. And the one that lights up Sulekha's eyes even as half her face is scarred by acid, a gift from a scorned lover.

                        <p>It is in this spirit of giving back to society, that Hands of Hope was born. The difference between our dreams and theirs is what jolted us to reality and what started with just one person has now become no less than a community which believes in the power of dreams.<br/><br/>From the desire to bring a smile to a face that has been without one for far too long. We don't promise the moon, but that doesn't mean we won't throw in a sling.</p>

                            <p>We stand for survival, for getting back on our feet after we have been shattered into the smallest pieces. We
                            stand for taking back our dignity from the fingers of those who thought they could snatch it from us. We stand for hope, we stand for contribution, we stand for thinking on our feet and helping with our hearts. We didnâ€™t wake up one morning armed with funds to help those in need. Nor are we all blessed with overflowing pockets that can be put to such use. All we have is a set of people who believe that the world is not a big bad wolf and even though we are appalled by the suffering endured by hundreds of people living not too far from our comfortable homes, we know we can make a difference.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">All we ask for is support.</span></p>

Our team is a dynamic mix of young blood and experienced minds not very different from a typical Indian family.Our rules are simple- We aren't a place for charity. We aren't a place where we donate clothes or a piece of cloth. We collect funds from people who still give a damn about society even though it is currently in shambles. We allocate your funds</p>
